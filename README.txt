KONTXT™ Semantic Engine is an AI site analyzer and content & product recommendation plugin providing valuable insights about your customers’ interactions (search queries, chat dialogs and customer service questions). Powered by KONTXT™ state of the art Natural Language Processing machine learning system.

== Description ==

KONTXT™ Semantic Engine leverages the latest deep learning semantic techniques to make predictions about your customers’ intents based on their inbound queries through chat, support requests, and search.

KONTXT™ Semantic Engine analyzes all search queries and customer’s interactions with your site and predicts their semantic intent ("why are they on your site and what do they really want?"). It also applies advanced parts-of-speech and semantic slot filling techniques to identify the main elements of your customer queries, allowing to group common queries into clusters and analyze their intent and effectiveness in the customer journey.

Moreover, it detects the emotional content for each interaction enabling you to analyze your brand’s connection with your customer and plots the major journey points that your customer take across your site.

Use these top of the funnel behavioral insights to analyze trends for demand planning, inventory optimization, brand sentiment and relationship optimization. These insights will help you improve your product and content set which result in better search results and improvements to your customer’s journey impacting loyalty, attrition and sales.

Data is encrypted in transit and deleted within 7 days of plugin deletion.

= Why am I not seeing analytical data? =

First, you must visit the settings page and opt-in. This plugin will only operate after you activate it and then opt-in. Depending on how your visitors engage with your site it may take an hour or a day to start seeing insights. You can submit test queries on your front end site to kick start the insights process.

= How do I get more people to use my search? =

Search is the best way to understand the intent behind your customers visit.  You need to make sure your search box is prominently display, is large enough to write longer sentences, and entices your audience to use more than single keywords!
